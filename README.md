# JS & the DOM Debugging Challenge

Fix the site!

To get started, open the `index.html` file with your favorite browser. You can do this in the browser (for example: `open index.html`, `chrome index.html`, `firefox index.html`). Use what you know about Javascript and HTML in order to fix the site. Be sure to test often and utilize the console to check your assumptions!
